# Train-Animations

🚆 Signal-Based Train Control System 🚦
1️⃣ What is this project? 💡
I created an interactive train control system where the train moves based on signal lights. 🚦 When you press the Red, Yellow, or Green button, the train reacts accordingly. This project is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2️⃣ How does it work? 🤔
🔴 Red Light: The train stays still.
🟡 Yellow Light: A countdown starts ⏳, and after 5 seconds, the train leaves.
🟢 Green Light: The train moves immediately.

Each button changes the signal light effects and train movement smoothly. 🚄

3️⃣ Technologies Used 🛠️
✅ HTML – Created the structure
✅ CSS – Styled the train, buttons, and platform
✅ JavaScript – Added animations and interactive buttons

I used JavaScript event listeners to detect button clicks and change train movement accordingly.

4️⃣ Challenges & Learnings 🎯
🚧 Challenge: Making the train move smoothly with the correct timing.
💡 Solution: Used setTimeout and setInterval to control delays and animations.

🚧 Challenge: Handling button interactions properly.
💡 Solution: Used CSS effects and JavaScript logic to make it visually clear.

This project helped me improve my event handling, animations, and user interactions in frontend development! 🚀

5️⃣ Next Steps 🚀
I’m planning to:
🔹 Add sound effects for a more realistic experience 🎵
🔹 Improve animations for smoother train movement
🔹 Convert it into a React.js project for better performance
